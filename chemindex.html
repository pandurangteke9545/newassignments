  <h1> Chemistry Assignment</h1>
  Chemistry is a branch of science that deals with the properties,
  composition and behavior of matter. It is a fascinating field that explores the building blocks of the universe.

  <h2>Chemical Elements</h2>
  The <mark>periodic table </mark>is a tabular arrangement of chemical elements. Each element is represented by its chemical symbol, such. 
  Fe for iron. H for hydrogen, and O for oxygen. Elements are classified and periodic based on their properties.

  <h2> Chemical Equations</h2>
  Chemical reaction are represented using <i>chemical equations.</i> Here's an example of a <i>chemical reaction:</i>
  
  <p>2H<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> &#8594;2H<sub>2</sub>O</p>
  <p>This equation represents the reaction between hydrogen gas(H<sub>2</sub>) and oxygen gas (O<sub>2</sub>) to form water (H<sub>2</sub>O).</p>

  <h3>Important Concepts</h3>
  Stoichiometry is the calculation of  reactants and products in chemical reactions. It involves balancing chemical equations to ensure the mass and charge we conserved.
  <p><sub>Subscripts</sub> indicate the number of atoms of each element in a molecule, while <sup>superscript</sup> represent charges or the number of atoms in an ion.</p>
  <h3>Conclusion</h3>
  Chemistry plays a crucial role in understanding the world around us. From the composition of the air we breathe to the reactions that power our bodies, chemistry influences every aspect of our lives.
